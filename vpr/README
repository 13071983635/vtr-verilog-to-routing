This directory contains the source and makefile for VPR as well
as three sample circuit netlists (tav.net xor5.net and e64.net) 
and a sample architecture file (sample.arch).  Xor5.net and tav.net
are very small circuits intended to allow one to become familiar with
VPR's netlist format, while e64.net is large enough to be a realistic
circuit.  Tav.net is a sequential circuit while the other two are 
combinational.

The FPGA described by sample.arch has logic blocks that contain 1
four-input look-up table and a flip-flop.  Each logic block pin is
accessable from one side of the logic block.  Two pads fit into the
area one logic block would occupy.
