This archive contains VPR, an FPGA placement and routing tool, and VPack,
a program to pack LUTs and flip flops into coarser grained logic blocks and
convert a netlist from blif format to VPR's .net format.  There is a detailed
postscript manual covering everything from how to compile the programs
to how to use them in manual422.ps

To see VPR in action on the (small) sample circuit (e64 from the MCNC 
benchmark suite) and the sample FPGA architecture files type:

cd vpr (if not already there)
vpr e64-4x4lut.net 4x4lut_sanitized.arch e64.p e64.r -route_chan_width 40 -inner_num 3

The logic block for this architecture contains 4, 4-input look-up tables and
4 flip flops along with local routing (a cluster-based logic block of size
4).  The routing wire segments all span 4 logic blocks in this architecture.


I've also included a simpler architecture in which a logic block is only a
4 LUT plus a flip flop, and in which all routing wires span only one logic
block.  To run this case, try:

cd vpr (if not already there)
vpr e64-4lut.net 4lut_sanitized.arch e64.p e64.r -route_chan_width 10 -inner_num 3


The two netlists (e64-4x4lut.net and e64-4lut.net) were created using VPack
on a technology-mapped netlist in .blif format, with the appropriate options
in each case:

cd vpack  (if not already there)
vpack e64.blif e64-4x4lut.net -cluster_size 4 -inputs_per_cluster 10

and

cd vpack  (if not already there)
vpack e64.blif e64-4lut.net -no_clustering



There are a lot of different ways to use VPR and VPack -- see manual422.ps
for details.

Major changes from VPR Version 3.99 to this Version (4.22)

1) A timing-driven router has been added to VPR, and is used by default.

2) VPR now supports routing architectures with wires that span more than
   1 logic block, and architectures that include both pass transistor and
   buffered routing switches.

3) Delay extraction and timing analysis have been added to VPR, so it now
   outputs the speed of a placed and routed circuit.

4) An area model has been incorporated, so it now estimates the area required
   to lay out an FPGA's routing.
